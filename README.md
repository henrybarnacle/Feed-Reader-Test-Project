# Feed Reader App Project

An an application to pull together feeds from several sites with the appility to switch between
feeds.
The challenge was to write test suites using the Jasmine development framework to test various
features of the app.
To run the tests, the file index.html must be loaded in the web browser. The red/green Jasmine
 panel will deisplay with details of the tests and their results in the relevant color to indicate
 passing or failing with details on where to find the possible causes in the case of failures.

 ## I made use of the Jasmine documentation to aid me in completing these tests suites, as well as the udacity forums and htmlgoodies.com.
